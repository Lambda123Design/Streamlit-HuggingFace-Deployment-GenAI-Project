# Streamlit-HuggingFace-Deployment-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files on "Streamlit and HuggingFace Deployments", an GenAI-Project

(i) Deployed Gen AI application using Streamlit Cloud for fast, no-cost web app deployment.

(ii) Structured GitHub repositories with essential files (app.py, requirements.txt) and pushed code for seamless integration with deployment platforms.

(iii) Configured API keys and secrets (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Groq) securely using st.secrets in Streamlit Cloud and environment variables in Hugging Face Spaces.

(iv) Demonstrated deployment on Hugging Face Spaces using CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, including .github/workflows/main.yaml to automatically push updates from GitHub to the Space.

(v) Enabled real-time interaction with deployed apps, supporting features like text summarization, Q&A, and multi-source information retrieval from Wikipedia, arXiv, and DuckDuckGo.
